# effective_recipe_crawler

This project is a web scraper/ web crawler, which takes a food recipe website and scrap its data to show the required recipes. 

Here I used my favorite recipe blog 'https://natashaskitchen.com/' for making the crawler that searches for breakfast items that can be made within 5 minutes. But the results can be changed by changing the input fields. One can search for lunch, dinner, appetizer, or any special cuisine with little changes.
